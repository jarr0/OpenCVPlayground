# About
OpenCV Playground is designed to make OpenCV easy for anyone. By uploading an image and choosing from a pregenerated snippet the user can change parameters and view in real time how they effect the output. This is made possible by live python generation in the backend. 

The inspiration from this proejct came from the way numerous online tutorials went about showing how to get started. They would use multiple different filters then have them all open in separate windows. I found this slow, and if the user wanted to see what different parameters did it felt clunky.
